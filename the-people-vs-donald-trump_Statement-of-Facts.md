# People v Donald J. Trump

IND-71543-23

## Statement of Facts

### INTRODUCTION

1. The defendant DONALD J. TRUMP repeatedly and fraudulently falsified NewYork business records to conceal criminal conduct that hid damaging information from thevoting public during the 2016 presidential election.
  
2. From August 2015 to December 2017, the Defendant orchestrated a scheme withothers to influence the 2016 presidential election by identifying and purchasing negativeinformation about him to suppress its publication and benefit the Defendant’s electoral prospects.In order to execute the unlawful scheme, the participants violated election laws and made andcaused false entries in the business records of various entities in New York. The participantsalso took steps that mischaracterized, for tax purposes, the true nature of the payments made infurtherance of the scheme.
  
3. One component of this scheme was that, at the Defendant’s request, a lawyer whothen worked for the Trump Organization as Special Counsel to Defendant (“Lawyer A”),covertly paid $130,000 to an adult film actress shortly before the election to prevent her from publicizing a sexual encounter with the Defendant. Lawyer A made the $130,000 paymentthrough a shell corporation he set up and funded at a bank in Manhattan. This payment wasillegal, and Lawyer A has since pleaded guilty to making an illegal campaign contribution and served time in prison. Further, false entries were made in New York business records toeffectuate this payment, separate and apart from the New York business records used to concealthe payment.

4. After the election, the Defendant reimbursed Lawyer A for the illegal paymentthrough a series of monthly checks, first from the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust (the“Defendant’s Trust”)—a Trust created under the laws of New York which held the Trump Organization entity assets after the Defendant was elected President—and then from theDefendant’s bank account. Each check was processed by the Trump Organization, and eachcheck was disguised as a payment for legal services rendered in a given month of 2017 pursuantto a retainer agreement. The BA records, kept and maintained by the Trump Organization,were false New York business records. In truth, there was no retainer agreement, and Lawyer Awas not being paid for legal services rendered in 2017. The Defendant caused his entities’ business records to be falsified to disguise his and others’ criminal conduct.

### BACKGROUND

5. The Defendant is the beneficial owner of a collection of business entities known by the trade name the Trump Organization. The Trump Organization comprises approximately 500 separate entities that, among other business activities, own and manage hotels, golf courses,commercial real estate, condominium developments, and other properties. The Trump Organization is headquartered at 725 Fifth Avenue in New York County.

6. From approximately June 2015 to November 2016, the Defendant was a candidatefor the office of President of the United States. On January 20, 2017, he became President of the United States.

### THE SCHEME

#### I. The Catch and Kill Scheme to Suppress Negative Information

7. During and in furtherance of his candidacy for President, the Defendant andothers agreed to identify and suppress negative stories about him. Two parties to this agreementhave admitted to committing illegal conduct in connection with the scheme. In August 2018,Lawyer A pleaded guilty to two federal crimes involving illegal campaign contributions, andsubsequently served time in prison. In addition, in August 2018, American Media, Inc. (“AMI”),a media company that owned and published magazines and supermarket tabloids including the National Enquirer , admitted in a non-prosecution agreement that it made a payment to a sourceof a story to ensure that the source “did not publicize damaging allegations” about the Defendant“before the 2016 presidential election and thereby influence that election.”

##### A. The 2015 Trump Tower Meeting

8. In June 2015, the Defendant announced his candidacy for President of the UnitedStates.

9. Soon after, in August 2015, the Defendant met with Lawyer A and AMI’sChairman and Chief Executive Officer (the “AMI CEO”) at Trump Tower in New York County.At the meeting, the AMI CEO agreed to help with the Defendant’s campaign, saying that hewould act as the “eyes and ears” for the campaign by looking out for negative stories about theDefendant and alerting Lawyer A before the stories were published. The AMI CEO also agreedto publish negative stories about the Defendant’s competitors for the election.

##### B. Suppressing the Doorman’s Story

10. A few months later, in or about October or November 2015, the AMI CEOlearned that a former Trump Tower doorman (the “Doorman”) was trying to sell informationregarding a child that the Defendant had allegedly fathered out of wedlock. At the AMI CEO’s direction, AMI negotiated and signed an agreement to pay the Doorman $30,000 to acquireexclusive rights to the story. AMI falsely characterized this payment in AMI’s books andrecords, including in its general ledger. AMI purchased the information from the Doormanwithout fully investigating his claims, but the AMI CEO directed that the deal take place becauseof his agreement with the Defendant and Lawyer A.

11. When AMI later concluded that the story was not true, the AMI CEO wanted torelease the Doorman from the agreement. However, Lawyer A instructed the AMI CEO not torelease the Doorman until after the presidential election, and the AMI CEO complied with thatinstruction because of his agreement with the Defendant and Lawyer A.C. Suppressing Woman 1’s Account

12. About five months before the presidential election, in or about June 2016, theeditor-in-chief of the National Enquirer  and AMI’s Chief Content Officer (the “AMI Editor-in-Chief”) contacted Lawyer A about a woman (“Woman 1”) who alleged she had a sexualrelationship with the Defendant while he was married. The AMI Editor-in-Chief updatedLawyer A regularly about the matter over text message and by telephone. The Defendant did notwant this information to become public because he was concerned about the effect it could haveon his candidacy. Thereafter, the Defendant, the AMI CEO, and Lawyer A had a series ofdiscussions about who should pay off Woman 1 to secure her silence.

13. AMI ultimately paid $150,000 to Woman 1 in exchange for her agreement not tospeak out about the alleged sexual relationship, as well as for two magazine cover features ofWoman 1 and a series of articles that would be published under her byline. AMI falselycharacterized this payment in AMI’s books and records, including in its general ledger. TheAMI CEO agreed to the deal after discussing it with both the Defendant and Lawyer A, and on the understanding from Lawyer A that the Defendant or the Trump Organization wouldreimburse AMI.

14. In a conversation captured in an audio recording in approximately September2016 concerning Woman 1’s account, the Defendant and Lawyer A discussed how to obtain therights to Woman 1’s account from AMI and how to reimburse AMI for its payment. Lawyer Atold the Defendant he would open up a company for the transfer of Woman 1’s account and otherinformation, and stated that he had spoken to the Chief Financial Officer for the Trump Organization (the “TO CFO”) about 

> “how to set the whole thing up.” 

14. (cont) The Defendant asked, 

> “So what do we got to pay for this? One fifty?” 

14. (cont) and suggested paying by cash. When Lawyer A disagreed, the Defendant then mentioned payment by check. After the conversation, Lawyer A created a shell company called `Resolution Consultants, LLC` on or about September 30, 2016.

15. Less than two months before the election, on or about September 30, 2016, theAMI CEO signed an agreement in which AMI agreed to transfer its rights to Woman 1’s accountto Lawyer A’s shell company for $125,000. However, after the assignment agreement wassigned but before the reimbursement took place, the AMI CEO consulted with AMI’s generalcounsel and then told Lawyer A that the deal to transfer the rights to Lawyer A’s shell companywas off.D. Suppressing Woman 2’s Account

16. About one month before the election, on or about October 7, 2016, news broke that the Defendant had been caught on tape saying to the host of Access Hollywood 

> “I just start kissing them [women]. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. . . . Grab ’em by the [genitals]. You can do anything.”

16. (cont) The evidence shows that both the Defendant and his campaign staff were concerned that the tape would harm his viability as a candidate and reduce his standing with female voters in particular.

17. Shortly after the Access Hollywood tape became public, the AMI Editor-in-Chief contacted the AMI CEO about another woman (“Woman 2”) who alleged she had a sexual encounter with the Defendant while he was married. The AMI CEO told the AMI Editor-in-Chief to notify Lawyer A.

18. On or about October 10, 2016, the AMI Editor-in-Chief connected Lawyer A with Woman 2’s lawyer (“Lawyer B”). Lawyer A then negotiated a deal with Lawyer B to secure Woman 2’s silence and prevent disclosure of the damaging information in the final weeks before the presidential election. Under the deal that Lawyer B negotiated, Woman 2 would be paid $130,000 for the rights to her account.

19. The Defendant directed Lawyer A to delay making a payment to Woman 2 aslong as possible. He instructed Lawyer A that if they could delay the payment until after theelection, they could avoid paying altogether, because at that point it would not matter if the story became public. As reflected in emails and text messages between and among Lawyer A, LawyerB, and the AMI Editor-in-Chief, Lawyer A attempted to delay making payment as long as possible.

20. Ultimately, with pressure mounting and the election approaching, the Defendantagreed to the payoff and directed Lawyer A to proceed. Lawyer A discussed the deal with theDefendant and the TO CFO. The Defendant did not want to make the $130,000 paymenthimself, and asked Lawyer A and the TO CFO to find a way to make the payment. After discussing various payment options with the TO CFO, Lawyer A agreed he would make the payment. Before making the payment, Lawyer A confirmed with the Defendant that Defendant would pay him back.

21. On or about October 26, shortly after speaking with the Defendant on the phone,Lawyer A opened a bank account in Manhattan in the name of Essential Consultants LLC, a newshell company he had created to effectuate the payment. He then transferred $131,000 from his personal home equity line of credit (“HELOC”) into that account. On or about October 27,Lawyer A wired $130,000 from his Essential Consultants LLC account in New York to LawyerB to suppress Woman 2’s account.E. Post-Election Communications with AMI CEO

22. On November 8, 2016, the Defendant won the presidential election and becamethe President-Elect. Thereafter, AMI released both the doorman and Woman 1 from their non-disclosure agreements.

23. The Defendant was inaugurated as President on January 20, 2017. BetweenElection Day and Inauguration Day, during the period of the Defendant’s transition to his role asPresident, the Defendant met with the AMI CEO privately in Trump Tower in Manhattan. TheDefendant thanked the AMI CEO for handling the stories of the Doorman and Woman 1, andinvited the AMI CEO to the Inauguration. In the summer of 2017, the Defendant invited the AMI CEO to the White House for a dinner to thank him for his help during the campaign.

#### II. The Defendant Falsified Business Records

24. Shortly after being elected President, the Defendant arranged to reimburse Lawyer A for the payoff he made on the Defendant’s behalf. In or around January 2017, the TOCFO and Lawyer A met to discuss how Lawyer A would be reimbursed for the money he paid toensure Woman 2’s silence. The TO CFO asked Lawyer A to bring a copy of a bank statementfor the Essential Consultants account showing the $130,000 payment.

25. The TO CFO and Lawyer A agreed to a total repayment amount of $420,000.They reached that figure by adding the $130,000 payment to a $50,000 payment for another expense for which Lawyer A also claimed reimbursement, for a total of $180,000. The TO CFOthen doubled that amount to $360,000 so that Lawyer A could characterize the payment asincome on his tax returns, instead of a reimbursement, and Lawyer A would be left with $180,000 after paying approximately 50% in income taxes. Finally, the TO CFO added anadditional $60,000 as a supplemental year-end bonus. Together, these amounts totaled $420,000. The TO CFO memorialized these calculations in handwritten notes on the copy of the bank statement that Lawyer A had provided.

26. The Defendant, the TO CFO, and Lawyer A then agreed that Lawyer A would be paid the $420,000 through twelve monthly payments of $35,000 over the course of 2017. Eachmonth, Lawyer A was to send an invoice to the Defendant through Trump Organizationemployees, falsely requesting payment of $35,000 for legal services rendered in a given monthof 2017 pursuant to a retainer agreement. At no point did Lawyer A have a retainer agreementwith the Defendant or the Trump Organization.

27. In early February 2017, the Defendant and Lawyer A met in the Oval Office at theWhite House and confirmed this repayment arrangement.

28. On or about February 14, 2017, Lawyer A emailed the Controller of the Trump Organization (the “TO Controller”) the first monthly invoice, which stated: 

> “Pursuant to theretainer agreement, kindly remit payment for services rendered for the months of January and February, 2017.” 

28. (cont) The invoice requested payment in the amount of $35,000 for each of those twomonths. The TO CFO approved the payment, and, in turn, the TO Controller sent the invoice to the Trump Organization Accounts Payable Supervisor (the “TO Accounts Payable Supervisor”)with the following instructions: 

> “Post to legal expenses. Put ‘retainer for the months of Januaryand February 2017’ in the description.”

29. Lawyer A submitted ten similar monthly invoices by email to the TrumpOrganization for the remaining months in 2017. Each invoice falsely stated that it was being submitted 

> “[p]ursuant to the retainer agreement,” 

29. (cont) and falsely requested 

> “payment for services rendered” 

29. (cont) for a month of 2017. In fact, there was no such retainer agreement and Lawyer A wasnot being paid for services rendered in any month of 2017.

30. The TO Controller forwarded each invoice to the TO Accounts Payable Supervisor. Consistent with the TO Controller’s initial instructions, the TO Accounts Payable Supervisor printed out each invoice and marked it with an accounts payable stamp and the general ledger code `51505` for legal expenses. The Trump Organization maintained theinvoices as records of expenses paid.

31. As instructed, the TO Accounts Payable Supervisor recorded each payment in the Trump Organization’s electronic accounting system, falsely describing it as a 

> “legal expense” 

31. (cont) pursuant to a retainer agreement for a month of 2017. The Trump Organization maintained adigital entry for each expense, called a 

> “voucher,” 

31. (cont) and these vouchers, like vouchers for other expenses, became part of the Trump Organization’s general ledgers.

32. The TO Accounts Payable Supervisor then prepared checks with attached checkstubs for approval and signature. The first check was paid from the Defendant’s Trust and signed by the TO CFO and the Defendant’s son, as trustees. The check stub *falsely* recorded the payment as 

> “Retainer for 1/1-1/31/17” and “Retainer for 2/1-2/28/17.” 

32. (cont) The second check, forMarch 2017, was also paid from the Trust and signed by two trustees. The check stub *falsely* recorded the payment as 

> “Retainer for 3/1-3/31/17.”

33. The remaining nine checks, corresponding to the months of April through December of 2017, were paid by the Defendant personally. Each of the checks was cut from the Defendant’s bank account and sent, along with the corresponding invoices from Lawyer A, from the Trump Organization in New York County to the Defendant in Washington, D.C. The checksand stubs bearing the false statements were stapled to the invoices also bearing false statements.The Defendant signed each of the checks personally and had them sent back to the Trump Organization in New York County. There, the checks, the stubs, and the invoices were scannedand maintained in the Trump Organization’s data system before the checks themselves weredetached and mailed to Lawyer A for payment.

34. The $35,000 payments stopped after the December 2017 payment.

#### III. The Investigation into Lawyer A and the Defendant’s Pressure Campaign

35. On or about April 9, 2018, the FBI executed a search warrant on Lawyer A’s residences and office. In the months that followed, the Defendant and others engaged in a publicand private pressure campaign to ensure that Lawyer A did not cooperate with law enforcement in the federal investigation.

36. On the day of the FBI searches, Lawyer A called to speak with the Defendant tolet him know what had occurred. In a return call, the Defendant told Lawyer A to “stay strong.”

37. On or about April 21, 2018, the Defendant publicly commented on Twitte encouraging Lawyer A not to 

>  “flip,” 

37. (cont) stating, 

> “Most people will flip if the Government lets themout of trouble, even if . . . it means lying or making up stories. Sorry, I don’t see [Lawyer A]doing that . . . .”

38. In mid-April 2018, Lawyer A was also approached by an attorney (“Lawyer C”),who offered to represent him in the interest of maintaining a “back channel of communication”to the Defendant. On or about April 21, 2018, Lawyer C emailed Lawyer A, highlighting that hehad a close relationship with the Defendant’s personal attorney (“Lawyer D”) and stating, 

> “[T]his could not be a better situation for the President or you.”

38. (cont) Later that day, Lawyer C emailed Lawyer A again, writing, 

> “I spoke with [Lawyer D]. Very Very Positive. You are‘loved.’ . . . [Lawyer D] said this communication channel must be maintained. . . . Sleep well tonight, you have friends in high places.”

39. On or about June 14, 2018, Lawyer C emailed Lawyer A a news clip discussingthe possibility of Lawyer A cooperating, and continued to urge him not to cooperate with law enforcement, writing, 

> “The whole objective of this exercise by the [federal prosecutors] is to drain you, emotionally and financially, until you reach a point that you see them as your onlymeans to salvation.” 

39. (cont) In the same email , Lawyer C, wrote, 

> “You are making a very big mistakeif you believe the stories these ‘journalists’ are writing about you. They want you to cave. Theywant you to fail. They do not want you to persevere and succeed.”

40. On August 21, 2018, Lawyer A pleaded guilty in the federal investigation. Thenext day, on or about August 22, 2018, the Defendant commented on Twitter, 

> “If anyone islooking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don’t retain the services of [Lawyer A]!” 

40. (cont) Later that day, the Defendant posted to Twitter again, stating, 

> “I feel very badly for” one ofhis former campaign managers who had been criminally charged, saying, “[U]nlike [Lawyer A],he refused to ‘break’ – make up stories in order to get a ‘deal.’”

#### IV. Lawyer A and AMI Admit Guilt in Connection with Payoffs of Woman 1 and Woman 2

41. Ultimately, other participants in the scheme admitted that the payoffs wereunlawful.

42. In or about September 2018, AMI entered into a non-prosecution agreement withthe United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York in connection withAMI’s payoff of Woman 1, admitting that 

> “[a]t no time during the negotiation or acquisition of [Woman 1’s] story did AMI intend to publish the story or disseminate information about it publicly.” 

42. (cont) Rather, AMI admitted that it made the payment to ensure that Woman 1 

> “did not publicize damaging allegations” 

42. (cont) about the Defendant 

> “before the 2016 presidential election andthereby influence that election.”

43. In August 21, 2018, Lawyer A pleaded guilty to a felony in connection with his role in AMI’s payoff to Woman 1, admitting in his guilty plea that he had done so at the Defendant’s direction:

```
[O]n or about the summer of 2016,in coordination with, and at the directionof, a candidate for federal office, I and the CEO of a media company at therequest of the candidate worked together to keep an individual with informationthat would be harmful to the candidate and to the campaign from publiclydisclosing this information. After a number of discussions, we eventuallyaccomplished the goal by the media company entering into a contract with theindividual under which she received compensation of $150,000. I participated in this conduct, which on my part took place in Manhattan, for the principal purposeof influencing the election.(emphasis added).
```
44. Lawyer A also pleaded guilty to a felony in connection with his payoff of Woman2 to secure her silence, again at the Defendant’s direction. Lawyer A admitted as part of hisguilty plea:

```
[O]n or about October of 2016, in coordination with, and at the direction of,the same candidate, I arranged to make a payment to a second individual withinformation that would be harmful to the candidate and to the campaign to keepthe individual from disclosing the information. To accomplish this, I used a company that was under my control to make a payment in the sum of $130,000. The monies I advanced through my company were later repaid to me by the candidate. I participated in this conduct, which on my part took place in Manhattan, for the principal purpose of influencing the election.(emphasis added).
